Twitter timeline based moblog on your sidebar. If you post image file onto twitter, this widget automatically pulls most recent image from supported image storage site.

== Description ==

This is moblog. This widget displays most recent image from your twitter time-line so if you post image (with/without text) onto twitter, the widget automatically pulls its image and display at your blogâ€™s sidebar with fancy frames.

You can select frames from one of mine, but if you want to use your own image, specify filename at option panel and you will see it!

Currently this supports http://snipurl.com, http://twitpic.com and http://movapic.com to pull data from twitter (all those are twitter-based imaging service).

You can select build-in fancy picture frames. Original (your own made) frames are also supported.
